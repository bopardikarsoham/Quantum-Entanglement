# Quantum-Entanglement
In this repository, I have programmed The Quantum Teleportation Algorithm with the help of Qiskit.

-->Quantum Entanglement : The quantum correlation between two objects that cannot be desrcibed using classical mechanics.

-->Why do we use this algorithm ? It has awesome applications like Quantum Teleportation, Quantum Cryptography, Superdense Coding and Quantum speedups. This property of a quantum computer makes it better than a classical computer.

-->How will we use it ? In order to implement this algorithm, we will be creating the following circuit below.



-->Aim : To transfer quantum states from q0 to q2 with q1 as a medium.

-->Role of classical bits : To convey the measurements of the quantum operations in a classical computer.
